## 📌 Quick Tips for a Smooth Bike‑Centred Trip

1. **Bike Check‑list** – before riding, verify brakes, tire pressure, and chain lubrication. The rental shop will give you a quick inspection sheet.  
2. **Helmet & Gloves** – always wear the provided helmet; a pair of gloves adds comfort on gravel sections.  
3. **Fuel/Charge** – if you rent a scooter, keep a spare 1 L petrol can (≈ ₹90) for the longer hill‑drive.  
4. **Parking** – most beaches and hill bases have free open parking; lock the bike securely.  
5. **Hydration** – carry a 1‑liter reusable bottle (refill at guesthouse or public taps).  
6. **Cash** – most small vendors accept only cash; keep ₹500‑₹1,000 in small notes for snacks and entry‑free sites.  

Enjoy the crisp sea breeze, the emerald‑green slopes of **Paithalamala Hill**, and the freedom of exploring Kannur on two wheels! 🚴‍♂️🏖️🏞️
